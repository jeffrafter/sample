# Getting the code

First things first, you need the repository:

    git clone git@github.com:YOURUSERNAME/sample.git

Once you have that you'll want to switch to that folder. This project was built using
Rails 4.0.x and Ruby 2.0.0-p247 Ruby versions are managed with rbenv and when switching to
the folder you should receive a notice that you need to install ruby if it is missing.

Once you have the code you should be able to bundle.
